# Week Seven Reading Assignment
#### *Parking search caused congestion: Whereâ€™s all the fuss?*
#### By Weinberger, Millard-Ball & Hampshire (2018)

From the beginning, this paper caught my attention due to the fact that I had never really thought about the quantification of "cruising." Grabbing from personal experience, I always just complained that I couldn't find parking and that the city should just "do" something about it. However, I never put much thought into how the city would "do something." I appreciated the fact that the researchers used GPS data in addition to video. I think that often times, if we rely too much on the numbers, it doesn't tell the whole story of what is truly happening. Something I really liked about the research is that they accounted for the various situations that may occur when someone is looking for parking. For example, they didn't include "cruising" for situation when someone parked in the first spot they saw despite the fact that they haven't reached their destination yet. I think this research has significant policy and environmental implications. It could help inform local electeds on how to increase the use of public transportation. Similarly, local electeds could add to the research and look at the pollution that may be caused due to "cruising" in the hot spot identified by the researchers. On the other hand, I think this research could also have a negative impact in that more parking garages or paid parking spaces may be identified as the solution to these problems.

Questions:
- Do you forsee any negative impacts from your research--such as an increase in paid parking garage infrastructure?
- How can an NGO or local community member utilize this data to advocate for public transportation? What about air pollution?
