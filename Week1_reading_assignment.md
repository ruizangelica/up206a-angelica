In this article the authors discuss the ways in which more vegetation in an area is usually seen as a positive thing: more "greenspace." However, with the increase of vacancies in urban areas there is also an increase in unkept vegetation. As a result, when researchers or policy makers utlize spatial tools that show the greenspace in the city, it may look as more equitable with regards to greenspace despite the economic blight and poverty in the area. The researchers used the city of Toledo for their research due to the fact that it's a declining city in the northwest. The results of the study confirmed their hypothesis that increase vegetation should not be used as a tool for environmental justice policies. In doing so, funding and resources may not be directed towards the communities that need them the most. 

I found the article interesting and unique in the way that they utilized data that might not be viewed as complementary. Often times greenery and implementing green-based solutions to vulnerable communities is seen as a positive. However, I found it really interesting for the researchers to think about communities that may be left behind due to the "check list" that may be used to decide which community qualifies for the support. I liked this article with regards to data approaches because the researchers were able to combine their various backgrounds and specialities into one research question of interest. The used traditional data (i.e. demographic, census) and combined it with satellite data. Additionally, they intersected all of the aforementioned data with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which provided a great way to summarize data into one factor. This helps inform my own data science goals because it shows me that I am still able to use traditional data and data methods (i.e. regression, correlations) in combination with spatial data in order to address an issue. I am not limited to analyzing data in one way, but instead am able to combine and intersect them in order to tell an impactful story within my research.
