# Midterm: Updated Project Proposal
## Title-- America’s Shopping Cart: The Public Health Impacts of Warehouse Infrastructure in the Inland Empire
### UP 206A | Winter 2021 | By: Angelica Ruiz

### **INTRODUCTION** 
Although Los Angeles, CA is often seen as the center for transportation of goods due to the ports that exist there, about 65 miles east lies the country’s largest logistics distribution hub: the Inland Empire. In the span of about 10 years, over 150 million square feet of industrial space has been converted to warehouse—-which equates to the size of about 3,300 football fields ([Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/are-warehouses-inland-empire-blessing-or-curse)). The Inland Empire is composed of various cities within Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. In Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, 49.6% and 54% of the population is Latinx, respectively; and the poverty rate is 14.7% and 17.3%, respectively ([Data USA](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/riverside-county-ca#health)). The residents of both these counties have historically been exposed to hazardous air toxins due to decades of racist land use and zoning policies promoted. The maintenance and expansion of warehouses has led to more truck traffic, noise pollution, diesel exposure, cancer-causing toxins, and horrible air quality ([Grist](https://grist.org/justice/in-the-shadow-of-amazon-resistance-takes-root-in-san-bernardino/), [Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/are-warehouses-inland-empire-blessing-or-curse)). In 2019, the American Lung Association listed Riverside and San Bernardino Counties as the most ozone-polluted places in the U.S. ([Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/are-warehouses-inland-empire-blessing-or-curse)). Furthermore, asthma rates in the Inland Empire are twice as high as the national average ([Earth Justice](https://earthjustice.org/blog/2020-april/amazon-inland-empire-workers-covid-19)). 

As a result of the multifaceted pollution caused by the warehouses in the Inland Empire, for my research project I will examine the extent to which the warehouses impact the health of the residents living in the area. Through spatial data analysis and mapping, I hope to show how the density of warehouse in the Inland Empire, coupled with the pollution burden on the residents in the area, is of concern and merits action from local and state officials. 

#### _**Research Question:**_
- What are the potential public health and environmental impacts of warehouses in the Inland Empire? 

### **IMPORTANCE**
Despite the significant reduction of poor air quality in California in the past few decades, the reduction has not been equal across all counties. In spite of efforts to halt expansion of warehouses from local organizations, such as Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice (CCAEJ) and the People's Collective for Environmental Justice (PC4EJ), local officials continue to push toward what they view as “economic growth.” Various studies have shown the significant negative impact of chronic exposure to air pollution and diesel contaminants. Regardless of the studies, not enough research or analysis has been conducted on this issue and its public health effects. Therefore, it is crucial that further exploration is conducted in order to support community efforts and hold local officials accountable to the health and well-being of their constituents. 

### **METHODS**
*Spatial Scope*

The spatial scope of the project will be the counties of Riverside and San Bernardino located in Southern California. Further focus will be on the areas within the cities that have warehouses, since I’m assuming not all of the land within the county is comprised of solely warehouses. Space matters for this project because of the unique environmental justice issue that is prevalent in the region, paired with the myriad of toxins that also impact the community. Time is important for this project because of the rapid expansion of warehouses infrastructure in the Inland Empire. Additionally, expanded data analysis done now could provide insight into the public health and environmental changes associated with warehouse infrastructure, both retrospectively and prospectively. 

*Data Sources*

The data that I've been using and hope to continue using are the same one from my original proposal, with the except of the county map. I want to ensure that the spatial story I tell with the data is reflective of the lived experiences of the residents impacted. Thus far, I have identified the following data sources:

- Base map data: The land use dataset will be utilized to show the designated land use, as defined by the county. There are specific codes used to identify warehouses, which I’ll filter to focus on the warehouse codes. 
  - SCAG—Land use
    - [Riverside County](https://gisdata-scag.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/landuse-combined-riverside)
    - [San Bernardino County](https://gisdata-scag.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/landuse-combined-san-bernardino-)
- Demographic data
  - Census Reporter
    - [Riverside County](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/05000US06065-riverside-county-ca/)
    - [San Bernardino County](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/05000US06071-san-bernardino-county-ca/)
- Health and environmental data

### **INSIGHTS**
Through this project, I hope to offer additional evidence regarding the health impacts of the high density of warehouses in the Inland Empire. In order to ensure that the community’s concerns are addressed, I hope to work with CCAEJ and PC4EJ to tailor the final product into a tool they can use for their advocacy. I hope that this project deliverable will be useful to community leaders in advocating for environmental justice and ensuring that the health of the residents in the region are prioritized.
