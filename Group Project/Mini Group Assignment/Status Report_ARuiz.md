# Status Report 
### Title-- Americaâ€™s Shopping Cart: The Public Health Impacts of Warehouse Infrastructure in the Inland Empire
####  UP 206A | Winter 2021 | By: Angelica Ruiz

**Proposal**

The original proposal for my project can be found [HERE](https://github.com/ruizangelica/up206a-angelica/blob/main/Group%20Project/Group%20Assignment%20%231:%20Project%20Proposal/Proposal_ARuiz.md).

**Status Update**

I'm feeling a little overwhelmed with the catch up that I have to do for the project. I ended up changing my topic and choosing to work alone about a week ago due to family emergency. As a result, I've been a little nervous on how I can tell the story I want and map the data in a way that's helpful to the NGOs that I want to share it with. However, I'm still feeling pretty confident in my ability to tell the story I want for my project and excited to see what the final product will be. I've taken a peek at the previous class' final project and it so nice! They were able to tell a story with the data and maps, and I hope that's something that I can do for my project too. Things that are working for me are the class labs; they really help me expand how I originally thought I wanted to do the project. There are so many resources and tools that I feel I can use to create the maps I want. Also, I feel like my question is narrow enough to where I won't be overwhelmed, but broad enough to where I can have various data points/variables to map. Things that aren't working for me is my expectations of what I want to do. I look at maps of how I want my maps to look, but I know that some of what exists is advanced, and I'm still learning. 

**Data Update**

The data sources that I first identified in my project proposal are still the ones that I'll be using. Luckily (and unluckily I guess) I had some extra time to look for data sources for my research project. Thus far it seems like I'll be able to use my land-use data set from [SCAG](https://gisdata-scag.opendata.arcgis.com/search?tags=Land%20Use), that was shared to me by a classmate (I forgot who it was, but thank you!). My only obstacle in the data I've found is that the two counties I'm analyzing have different datasets. I haven't been able to find an "Inland Empire" dataset that has both Riverside and San Bernardino County. So, I've only been able to do preliminary analyses on Riverside County. I still need to figure out how to merge the two datasets, or at least have both of them as a basemap. 

**Concerns**

- Minor concerns
  - Figuring out how to merge the two county databases, both the land-use data and the census demographic data
  - Learning more tools to make the maps aesthically pleasing and cooler
- Major concerns
  - Creating new variables out of my current data
    - For example, similar to CalEnviroScreen, finding a way to show that a certain race is more burdened by poverty. Essentially, figuring out the calculations I need to show what I want
  - Finding locations of warehouses in the Inland Empire. Currently, I only have land use data, but that doesn't necessarily tell me where the warehouses are located
  - Layering the data in the same map
    - For example, add the county data with the land use data, and then showing points of where the warehouses are located
