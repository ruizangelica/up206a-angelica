 ## Who am I?
 I'm a 2nd year Master of Public Health student in the Environmental Health Sciences Department. Using an intersectional framework, my interests are focused on social and environmental justice, as they relate to public health and biostatistics. I aim to work alongside community members from environmental justice communities in order to address and tackle systemic injustices. 

In my free time, I enjoy attending music, reading, crocheting, and hanging out with my dog, Yolilitzli. Some of my favorite artists include Cafe Tacuba, Bomba Estereo, Queen, and Los Saicos. My *all-time* favorite author is Octavia E. Butler.

## Project Ideas
As I previously mentioned, I'm very much interested in topics related to environmental justice. I'm interested in analyzing the potential public health impacts of warehouses in the Inland Empire, due to the increase of traffic from trucks in the area. The Inland Empire is a hub for warehouses for various corporations, such as Amazon. As a result, there is also an increase in diesel trucks that drive through and/or near residential areas. I don't believe that there is enough data or analysis on such health impacts.

An additional project idea revolves around pesticide drift in farmworker communities and agricultural areas. In the Central Valley, there are many agricultural areas which use pesticides for crops. Despite the continued use of pesticides, I don't believe that there's enough analysis on the impact the use of pesticides may have in the surrounding communities. Various factors, such as wind, may cause the pesticides to drift further than otherwise known and cause negative health affects to the residents nearby.

## My Objective for the Class
For the class, I would like to learn more about Python itself, but also as a way to conduct spatial data analysis. I would like to learn more about spatial data science and the ways in which I can use the skills in my professional career. Additionally, I would like to teach what I have learned to NGO's that I may partner with or community leaders in the hope that they can utilize those skills to advance social justice, without reliance on outside entities.
